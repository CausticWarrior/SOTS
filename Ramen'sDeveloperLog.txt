Dev plans:
* Add dev item at some point
* Figure out a way to make the Titanium Forge have a diff ambient sound than the Adamantite Forge (not priority)
* Give moths a glow effect and dust
Fixes:
* Fix ambient tile sounds (maybe later zz)
* Give moths animations hopefully cause they look a lil ugly without them
