0.20.2:
1. New weapon: Plasma Accelerator
2. Reworked Bore Bullets
3. A handful of internal optimizations that should hopefully help out with relieving multiplayer lag. 
(Still unsure if this will actual work, but we were unable to replicate the lag on our side when testing)

0.20.1:
New Stuff: 
1. Implemented Tidal Spirit and Permafrost Spirit Staff
2. Implemented 2 new starter house variants (courtesy of Astrobit and Mushnib~)
3. Treasure Slimes have been reworked

Balancing:
1. Because baguette won the vote for the unanimously most underpower weapon in SOTS, it has now become bigger
2. Supernova hammer is bigger and has increased damage: 27 -> 30
3. Spirits now run away 2 seconds slower

Misc:
1. Small optimizations to Curse Dust particle drawing and potentially to Pot Generator (which should help alleviate lag in general)
2. Added a few more crafting recipes, along with changing some recipes to use recipe groups, making them easier to work with
3. Ancient Gold Spike works with trapsight/dangersense
4. A few other bug fixes
5. Pharaoh's Curse drops money when dying
6. Coconut Island no longer spawns on a random world side
