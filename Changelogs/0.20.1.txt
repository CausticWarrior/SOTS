New Stuff: 
1. Implemented Tidal Spirit and Permafrost Spirit Staff
2. Implemented 2 new starter house variants (courtesy of Astrobit and Mushnib~)
3. Treasure Slimes have been reworked

Balancing:
1. Because baguette won the vote for the unanimously most underpower weapon in SOTS, it has now become bigger
2. Supernova hammer is bigger and has increased damage: 27 -> 30
3. Spirits now run away 2 seconds slower

Misc:
1. Small optimizations to Curse Dust particle drawing and potentially to Pot Generator (which should help alleviate lag in general)
2. Added a few more crafting recipes, along with changing some recipes to use recipe groups, making them easier to work with
3. Ancient Gold Spike works with trapsight/dangersense
4. A few other bug fixes
5. Pharaoh's Curse drops money when dying
6. Coconut Island no longer spawns on a random world side
