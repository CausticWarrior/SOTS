A mod which may have something to do with secrets and shadows.
This mod's main plan is to add generated structures to the world, some are sort-of like roguelike dungeons.

!! This mod is early in development !!
!! A large world is recommended in order for the generated structures to spawn without overriding vanilla structures !!

Bosses -> Currently 6, all with original AI!
Items -> Nearly 450, unique gimmicks all around!

New Subclass (void)
-Unleash very powerful attacks, at a cost
-High risk, high reward
-Has melee, ranged, magic, and summon items

Major Stuctures:
-Pyramid Dungeon Worldgen
-Planetarium Temple Worldgen
-Plus a handful of smaller structures
