A mod which has nothing to do with secrets or shadows... yet
This mod's main plan is to add generated structures in the world, some are sort-of like roguelike dungeons.
NOTICE: This mod is not optimized for multiplayer, feel free to give it a try, but bugs might occur.
!! This mod is early in development !!
