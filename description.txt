A mod which has nothing to do with secrets or shadows... yet.
This mod's main plan is to add generated structures in the world, some are sort-of like roguelike dungeons.
!! This mod is early in development !!
!! A large world is recommended in order for the generated structures to spawn without overriding vanilla structures !!

Items -> Around 300, unique gimmicks all around!
