A mod which has nothing to do with secrets or shadows... yet.
This mod's main plan is to add generated structures in the world, some are sort-of like roguelike dungeons.
!! This mod is early in development !!
!! A large world is recommended in order for the generated structures to spawn without overriding vanilla structures !!

Bosses -> Currently 6, Mostly bullet hells
Items -> Around 350, unique gimmicks all around!

-A new resource similar to mana
-Unleash very powerful attacks
-Exists on melee, ranged, and magic items

Currents Stuctures:
-Ice Monument 
-Pyramid Dungeon Worldgen
