A mod which probably has something to do with Secrets and Shadows.
This mod's main plan is to add structures and other unique generation to the world, which can act as dungeons or help spice up exploration.

!! This mod is early in development !!
!! A large world is recommended in order for the generated structures to spawn without overriding vanilla structures !!

Bosses -> Currently 6, all with original AI!
Items -> Nearly 600, designed to be unique!
Ores -> 3

New Subclass: Void
-Unleash very powerful attacks, at a cost
-High risk, high reward
-Has melee, ranged, magic, and summon items

Major Stuctures: 2
-Pyramid Dungeon Worldgen
-Planetarium Temple Worldgen
-A generous amount of smaller structures
