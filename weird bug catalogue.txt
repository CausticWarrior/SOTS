Known Bugs/Issues:
1. Player freezing completely, locking out menu (conditions unknown)
	1. Seems to be actually a modder's toolkit error
2. Game crashes with Recipe Browser enabled
3. In Multiplayer, when some players run frame skip subtle and others do not, Time may be frozen forever by VM incubator
	1. Make sure to better sync or correct time freeze (sync other freeze related variables).


Complete:
1. Mod Loadable in 1.4
2. Projectile damage from enemies works properly (GetBaseDamage(NPC npc))!
3. Sound playing works!
4. Fixed void bar visuals!
5. Global NPC Loot and Gores work! 
6. Advisor HP scales properly
7. Treasure Slime/Transmutation table assets load correctly.
8. NPC spawning should be working correctly...
9. Shaders work!
10. Chests, Chairs, Dressers fixed!
11. NPC loot and spawns seem to work for 1.4!



Should be fixed:
1. Lag generates in multiplayer after a while of playing. (Maybe fixed?)
	1. Seem to generate client-side not server side..?
	2. No memory leak on single player, or client side when testing..?
	3. *Still seems to happen, but way less often and requires some hours (2+) of playing
2. Primitives crash. (Fixed?)
3 Earthen Construct causing freezes occassionally. Conditions unknown (usually after it goes of screen).
	1. Less frequent than before 0.20, but still happens? *Seems to be fixed now..?
