Should be fixed:
1. Lag generates in multiplayer after a while of playing. (Maybe fixed?)
	1. Seem to generate client-side not server side..?
	2. No memory leak on single player, or client side when testing..?
	3. *Still seems to happen, but way less often and requires some hours (2+) of playing
2. Primitives crash. (Fixed?)
3 Earthen Construct causing freezes occassionally. Conditions unknown (usually after it goes of screen).
	1. Less frequent than before 0.20, but still happens? *Seems to be fixed now..?
