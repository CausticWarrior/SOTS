Use blushie's element laser to learn... 
the lasers ai[0] is the start point
the lasers ai[1] is the end point
the laser is summoned by abomination, and chains between it captive elements
depending on the captive elements, the color and debuff of the laser changes, this will probably be arbitrary when you use it as a reference
the sprite used is a 4x4 white cube
