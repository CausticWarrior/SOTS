//Currently Unfixable?
1. Snakeskin armor may have minor visual/despawn bugs? (not a big deal)

//Balance
1. Shuriken slicer to vibrant iron
2. Dissolving Nether => Focus Crystal, Dissolving Frostbite => Permafrost Isocahedron, Dissolving Evil => Cursed Isocahedron
3. Zepline Room Expansion

//Check For Bugs
1. Check for other bosses that possibly need damage normalization

//Ideas (YTBA, yet to be added)
