The following is my development plans :D

//Balance
1. Shuriken slicer to vibrant iron

//Later--- Balance
2. Dissolving Nether => Focus Crystal, Dissolving Evil => Cursed Isocahedron
5. Soul Charm takes Avaritia Scouter drop, heals mana

//Check For Bugs
1. Check for other bosses that possibly need damage normalization
2. Test worldgen more

//Ideas (YTBA, yet to be added)
Priority: Remaining Spirits

1. Lashes Of Lightning (Void + Magic) (otherworld + electrum)
2. Thunder Jacket
	1. Recieving damage will deal massive damage back to the attacker, but drains void when hit
3. Spark Stompers (generates a greek fire trail behind you)
4. Replace all the Blood Essence items
	1. New Void Accessory: Platinum/Gold
		3. Upgrades into electrum battery, which removes the downside
6. New Ore, Spawns in space as little planet "clusters"
	1. It's called Electrum (plate), (yellow and blue) and can be mined with demonite level or above after having defeated Putrid Pinky
	2. It will also be craftable (for the people who don't have new worlds) silver + gold + otherworld fragment
	3. Requires a skyforge, and acts as an alternative to hellstone (clouds + electrum / obsidian + hellstone)
	4. Skyforge can be crafted out of hellforge and some of the ore if needed
	6. Electrum plats will be struck with lightning every now-and-then
		1. This super charges it, causing it to now zap nearby enemies (and players)
		2. Drops more electrum (*5-15)
8. Vibrant Iron/Lead Gear <= Iron + Glowing Mushroom + Earth Fragments (Early Game Ranged)
10. New Pyramid enemy
	1. Blockade Mimic
		1. Can spawn upon breaking a pyramid block
		2. can only move X/Y one at a time
		3. charges back and forth
		4. doesn't hurt you for a bit after spawning
		5. cannot go through walls (except after it first escapes one)
11. Tether Cord in pyramid
	1. Attaches a second player to you
13. Dissolving Element Blocks
	1. Give off cool particles, can be used in summoning rituals
16. Earthen Construct
	1. Hides behind wall like worm, pokes head out, shots player, hides back in wall, repeat
	2. Spirit hides in the background walls (alpha), and pokes it's head out trying to attack player
		1. Attacks somewhat around the player, rather than on the player
		2. Releases a few projectiles as it comes out
		3. 2 fake spirits do the same thing, but are smaller, less damaging, and cannot be attacked
18. Make a wall version of the Worldgen Capture
