The following is my development plans :D

//Currently Unfixable?
1. Snakeskin armor may have minor visual/despawn bugs? (not a big deal)

//Balance
1. Shuriken slicer to vibrant iron

//Later--- Balance
2. Dissolving Nether => Focus Crystal, Dissolving Frostbite => Permafrost Isocahedron, Dissolving Evil => Cursed Isocahedron
3. Cursed Isocahedron takes uranium drop/ celestial drop?
4. Focus Crystal takes subspace serpent drop
5. Soul Charm takes Avaritia Scouter drop

//Check For Bugs
1. Check for other bosses that possibly need damage normalization
2. Test worldgen more

//Ideas (YTBA, yet to be added)
Priority: Remaining Spirits

Putrid Pinky Spawn Animation -> Place down peanuts -> Pinky eats it -> pinky grows -> pinky explodes and transforms into monster

1. Lashes Of Lightning (Void + Magic) (otherworld + electrum)
2. Thunder Jacket
	1. Recieving damage will deal massive damage back to the attacker, but drains void when hit
3. Spark Stompers (generates a greek fire trail behind you)
4. Replace all the Blood Essence items
	1. New Void Accessory: Platinum/Gold
		3. Upgrades into electrum battery, which removes the downside
6. New Ore, Spawns in space as little planet "clusters"
	1. It's called Electrum (plate), (yellow and blue) and can be mined with demonite level or above after having defeated Putrid Pinky
	2. It will also be craftable (for the people who don't have new worlds) silver + gold + otherworld fragment
	3. Requires a skyforge, and acts as an alternative to hellstone (clouds + electrum / obsidian + hellstone)
	4. Skyforge can be crafted out of hellforge and some of the ore if needed
	6. Electrum plats will be struck with lightning every now-and-then
		1. This super charges it, causing it to now zap nearby enemies (and players)
		2. Drops more electrum (*5-15)
7. Goblinsteel + Permafrost fragments => Frigid Gear, baby versions of icy amalgamation drops (Early Game Mage)
8. Vibrant Iron/Lead Gear <= Iron + Glowing Mushroom + Earth Fragments (Early Game Ranged)
10. New Pyramid enemy
	1. Blockade Mimic
		1. Can spawn upon breaking a pyramid block
		2. can only move X/Y one at a time
		3. charges back and forth
		4. doesn't hurt you for a bit after spawning
		5. cannot go through walls (except after it first escapes one)
	2. Perturbed Soul
		1. More aggressive soul variant
		2. Same health and damage, but rushes you down
11. Tether Cord in pyramid
	1. Attaches a second player to you
12. Enchanted Sword and Pickaxe Shrines in pyramid
	1. Drops Blade Fragment or Drill Fragment	
	2. Enchanted Pickaxe //modify stats
	3. Arkhalis or Enchanted Sword
13. Dissolving Element Blocks
	1. Give off cool particles, can be used in summoning rituals
15. Gelled Leather armor => Wormwood Armor (Early Game Summon)
	1. Pre-Putrid Pinky
16. Earthen Construct
	1. Hides behind wall like worm, pokes head out, shots player, hides back in wall, repeat
	2. Spirit hides in the background walls (alpha), and pokes it's head out trying to attack player
		1. Attacks somewhat around the player, rather than on the player
		2. Releases a few projectiles as it comes out
		3. 2 fake spirits do the same thing, but are smaller, less damaging, and cannot be attacked
17. Frozen Construct
	1. Covered in spikes
	2. Rolls towards player, and around walls like blazing wheel
	3. Spririt has bullets rotating around it.
		1. Circles around the top parts of the screen.
		2. Launches the entire bullet ring at a time.
		3. Bullets leave ice spikes on the floor where they land.
18. Make a wall version of the Worldgen Capture
